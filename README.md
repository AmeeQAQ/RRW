Some games have their FPS capped to a certain value, usually 60, due to technical limitations in the physics engine. Running these games with a screen that outputs more than 60 Hz can be an awful experience, where those 60 FPS can feel like 40 or even 30 due to them being lower than your native refresh rate. This script aims to automate the process of changing it to smoothen the overall gaming experience.
